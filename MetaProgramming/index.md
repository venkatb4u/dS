# Meta Programming

*Enabling self-adapting code*

Meta-Programming [MP] an art of writing program with an ability to rewrite itself. ```eval```  a part of JS since the begin of Time(ES1) is a gimmick for MP.

In JS6 MP can be achieved with

* Symbols

* Proxies

* Reflections

# Symbols

 Symbols are new primitive types just like Number, String, and Boolean. They are tokens that serves as unique ID's for object properties
 
# Proxies

 In a nutshell proxies are used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations 
 
 By default, proxies don’t do much – in fact they don’t do anything. If you don’t set any “options”, your proxy will just work as a pass-through to the `target` object
 
# Reflect
 
 Reflect are build-in non constructable JS-object providing options to  self-inspect and manipulate its member attributes and methods
